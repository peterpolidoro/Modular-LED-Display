# Modular LED Displays

[![A modular display system for insect behavioral neuroscience](assets/Reiser2008.png){: width="40%" .float-right}](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.07.019)

LED-based systems offer a high level of control over the presentation of stimuli to model organisms. We document the ["modular display system for insect behavioral neuroscience"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.07.019) and its derivatives on this website. Major revisions to the systems are known as "Generations." Here we focus on [Generation 3](Generation 3) and [Generation 4](docs/G4-index.md), with a brief outlook to [Generation 5](Generation 5).

In the past 15 years of development, progress has been documented in various publications and locations. This page has two main goals: First, it is an attempt to collect these technical details and user guides in a single site. This part of the documentation takes the form of a data dump at times, but please feel encouraged to get in touch if you have questions, ideas for improvement, or your experience differs from the description. Secondly, this page attempts to provide an infrastructure for active developers and users to document the arenas and their use with the least possible effort. We currently generate this page from a hand full of code repositories. If you have documentation about the LED systems, related tools, or applications, please [reach out](Contact), and we try to integrate additional information.

Many researchers worldwide use [Generation 3](Generation 3) systems, but no further development goes into this generation. At Janelia, we migrated several rigs to [Generation 4](docs/G4-index.md) arenas, and methods papers are currently in preparation. We are presently developing [Generation 5](Generation 5) â€“ so stay tuned or [get in contact](Contact.md) if you want to know more.
