LED based systems offer a high level of control over the presentation of stimuli to model organisms. On this page we document the ["modular display system for insect behavioral neuroscience"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.07.019) and its derivatives. Major revisions to the systems are known as "Generations". Here we focus on [Generation 3](Generation 3) and [Generation 4](Generation 4), with a brief outlook to [Generation 5](Generation 5).

The progress made during the more than 15 years since its publication has been shared in a number of different locations. In a first step, we attempt to collect these technical details and user guides in this single location. While this has currently the form of a data dump, we provide guidance on the most recent and up-to-date knowledge wherever possible.


Currently, [Generation 3](Generation 3) has been used in many installation around the world. [Generation 4](Generation 4) arenas are being used at Janelia and methods papers are currently in preparation. [Generation 5](Generation 5) is currently being developed.
