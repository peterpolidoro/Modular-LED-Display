# Example how-to guide

Each page can only be in a single location in the menu – even though it can be moved fairly freely. To use the same page in different contexts, one could create pages like this and then just link to these other pages. Here an example:

If you want to setup a new setup, the following pages might be interesting for you:

1. [Theory and Practice of Insect Flight Simulators](/Panel/Generation%203/Software/docs/g2-user-guide.html): The following three sections give a timeless overview of how to do fly experiments. The other sections are more geared towards Generation 2 and 3 arenas.
    1. [History and Principles of Operation](/Panel/Generation%203/Software/docs/g2-user-guide.html#history-and-principles-of-operation): The origins in the 1960s
    2. [Tethering Flies](/Panel/Generation%203/Software/docs/g2-user-guide.html#tethering-flies): How to get *Drosophila* to "cooperate" in these experiments
    3. [Optical Wingbeat Analyzer](/Panel/Generation%203/Software/docs/g2-user-guide.html#optical-wingbeat-analyzer): How to set up flight experiments with a bit of Hütchenology
2. [Generation 4 arenas](/Panel/Generation%204/Documentation/docs/components.html) are currently recommended when setting up a new system. Read about [what you need](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/docs/G4_Hardware_Setup.html) to get started.
    1. The most recent [Arena board hardware description](/Panel/Generation%204/Arena/README.html)
    2. If you need to build the hardware, have a look at a description of the [G4 Panel](/Panel/Generation%204/Panel/README.html)
    3. Get the [Firmware](/Panel/Generation%204/Firmware/README.html) to [program the panels](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/G4%20Panel%20Programming/G4_Panel-programmer_instructions.html)
    4. [Verify that the setup is working](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/docs/G4_Verify.html)
3. There are [many excellent software tools](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/README.html) to setup your experiments. For example:
    1. Create [visual patterns](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/Motion_Maker_G4/About%20Motion%20Maker.html)
    2. Move these patterns with [functions](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/Function_Maker_G4/About%20Function%20Maker.html)
    3. [Setup your experiments](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/G4_Protocol_Designer/User-Instructions.html)
    4. [Run your experiments](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/G4_Protocol_Designer/User-Instructions.html#the-experiment-conductor)
    5. [Analyze your results](/Panel/Generation%204/Display_Tools/G4_Data_Analysis/Data_analysis_documentation.html)
