# Historic Background

In their publication ["A modular display system for insect behavioral neuroscience"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.07.019), Michael B. Reiser and Michael H. Dickinson introduce their system that is now know as "Generation 2". While the publication primarily focuses on the setup and data colleciton of this particular type of LED based flight arenas, the introduction gives a brief historic overview. This includes a link to Erich von Holst and Horst Mittelstaedt's 1950 publication of ["Das Reafferenzprinzip"](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00622503) describing experiments that demonstrate the link between the central nervous system and peripheral neurons. It also lists other early uses of flight arenas, such as fixed patterns rotating around the insect as in [Karl Georg Götz' 1964](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00288561) investigation of eye mutations, independent projections for each eye in [Karl Georg Götz' 1968](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00272517) observation of motion perception, and earlier uses of LED arenas by [Strauss, Schuster, and Götz in 1997](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/200/9/1281).

As part of this current website, Mark Frye, Michael B. Reiser, and Michael H. Dickinson give another less formal introduction in [Theory and Practice of Insect Flight Simulators](/Generation 3/Software/docs/g2-user-guide.md). This document not only gives a historic overview of arenas, but also explains how to tether flies, and how to use an optical wingbeat analyzer. The last parts of the document describe the Panel Controller and other elements that were specific to the Generation 2 and Generation 3 arenas, but they also introduce terms that have been used since. If you come across terms in newer documentations that are not introduced properly, your best guess is to look them up in this early guide, but please also [let us know about it](/Contact.md) and we will fix this.
