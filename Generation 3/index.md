# Generation 3

Information related to Generation 3 is located in two repostories: [Panel-G3-Hardware](https://github.com/reiserlab/Panel-G3-Hardware) and [Panel-G3-Software](https://github.com/reiserlab/Panel-G3-Software). 

The documentation to each of the project can be kept in the respective repositories. For example, this index file for Generation 3 is in the main documentation repository, while oages like "Controller" and "Arenas" are always pulling the latest version from the source, in this case [my own copy of the Hardware repository](https://github.com/floesche/Panel-G3-Hardware).
