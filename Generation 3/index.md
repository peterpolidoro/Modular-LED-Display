# Generation 3

Information related to Generation 3 is located in two repositories. Read more about [Panel-G3-Hardware]({{site.baseurl}}/Generation%203/Hardware/docs/) and [Panel-G3-Software]({{site.baseurl}}/Generation%203/Software/docs/software.html).

The documentation to each of the project can be kept in the respective repositories. For example, this index file for Generation 3 is in the main documentation repository, while pages like "Controller" and "Arenas" are always pulling the latest version from the source, in this case my own copy of the Hardware repository.
